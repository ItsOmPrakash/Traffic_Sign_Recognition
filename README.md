This project implements a Traffic Sign Recognition System using Deep Learning and Computer Vision as a minor project for the 5th semester.

The system is designed in a modular and scalable manner, starting with a basic CNN model and later improving performance by integrating MobileNetV2-based transfer learning for better accuracy and real-time usability.
